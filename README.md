# car_price_prediction
Car price prediction is an important task for car dealers, customers, and manufacturers. By using regression models, we can predict the price of a given car based on its features like make, model, year and other parameters. These models help to get a better understanding of the pricing data of different cars in the market. This will enable us to make better decisions when it comes to buying or selling a car. It also provides us with insights into the trends in the car industry that can be used by manufacturers and dealers to make better business decisions.

## Project Detailed Description
